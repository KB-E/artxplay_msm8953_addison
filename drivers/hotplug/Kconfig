        Automatically hotplugs the multiple cpu cores on and off
        based on cpu load and suspend stat

          Note that this will BREAK any runtime patching of the kernel text
          (i.e. anything that uses apply_alternatives,
          aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync, etc. including the various CPU
          errata workarounds in arch/arm64/kernel/cpu_errata.c).
